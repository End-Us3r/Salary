# Salary

This program calculates the gross pay for an employee based on their name, hours worked, and pay rate. It includes overtime pay if the employee worked more than 40 hours.

The program first defines a function called main(), which is the main entry point of the program. Within the main() function, the program prompts the user to enter the employee's name, hours worked, and pay rate. If the employee worked overtime (more than 40 hours), the program calculates the overtime pay rate and adds it to the regular pay rate. Then, the program calculates the pay for normal hours and overtime hours to get the gross pay.

Finally, the program prints out a summary of the employee's details (name, hours worked, pay rate, overtime hours, overtime pay, regular pay, and gross pay). The program uses formatted print statements to display the output in a clear and organized way.
